# now looking at the other terminal, the kernal boots as there is alot of 
# 	text showing it start up
# the kernal then wants us to login, according to assignment description, 
# 	login to root with no password
root

# now the kernal has started
# since we have the --no-reboot flag, we can type reboot and it should 
# 	exit and NOT reboot
reboot

# this in turn exits the kernal and when we go back to the terminal with the gdb, 
# 	we see that the process stopped indicatting that we were able to connect 
# 	and disconnect with the VM
